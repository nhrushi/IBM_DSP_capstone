    "### Introduction\n",
    "Trains are among the best transportation options across Europe. Train networks are responsible for guiding 8 billion passengers to their destinations across Europe in the year 2018 and this number has been growing ever since. With a large exposure of consumers commuting through train stations, the commercial areas around train stations have been attracting infrastructure investments. In this project, we will analyze the most common investments around/near train stations across Europe. "

The presented data was part of a kaggle dataset. After removing unnecessary columns, we will have columns with name of train stations, latitude and longitude values. The much needed details of venues was obtained through Foursquare API.\n"
